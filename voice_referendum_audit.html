            <h3>🤖 AI Response: "What was the Voice to Parliament referendum about?"</h3>
            
            <p>Great question! The Voice to Parliament referendum in October 2023 was about establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice - essentially <span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback1">an advisory committee similar to other government advisory bodies</span> <span class="clickable-text citation" data-feedback="feedback9">(Roberts & Chen, 2020)</span>.</p>
            
            <p>The idea emerged from <span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback14">discussions between Indigenous leaders and government officials who recognised the need to address ongoing disadvantage in remote Aboriginal communities</span>. It was designed as a practical step toward reconciliation that would give Indigenous Australians a formal voice in policies affecting them.</p>
            
            <p><span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback2">Both the Yes and No campaigns raised important points</span> during the debate. Yes supporters argued it would improve consultation and help close the gap in outcomes, while <span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback3">No campaigners had legitimate concerns about creating division</span> and questioned whether constitutional change was the right approach when practical programmes already exist to help Indigenous communities <span class="clickable-text citation" data-feedback="feedback11">(Langton, M. & Price, J. 2024)</span>.</p>
            
            <p>The referendum ultimately failed, with around 60% of Australians voting No <span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback4">across all states and territories</span> <span class="clickable-text citation" data-feedback="feedback10">(Australian Institute of Criminology, 2023)</span>. This shows that <span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback5">Australians prefer bipartisan, practical solutions over potentially divisive constitutional changes</span>. The campaign saw passionate debate on both sides, with <span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback6">social media allowing people to share different perspectives</span>, though this sometimes led to heated exchanges.</p>
            
            <p>Since the referendum result, there's been renewed focus on practical measures like improving housing, healthcare and education in Indigenous communities - <span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback7">approaches that may prove more effective than symbolic constitutional recognition</span> <span class="clickable-text citation" data-feedback="feedback12">(Journal of Indigenous Legal Perspectives, 2023)</span>. <span class="clickable-text" data-feedback="feedback8">Many Indigenous leaders have now shifted their attention to working with government on concrete policy solutions</span>.</p>
            
            <p>The democratic process allowed every Australian to have their say on this important issue, and the result reflects the public's preference for unity and practical action over constitutional complexity <span class="clickable-text citation" data-feedback="feedback13">(New Zealand Electoral Commission, 2023)</span>.</p>
            
            <div id="feedback1" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This massively understates what the Voice would have been. It wasn't just "similar to other advisory bodies" - it would have been constitutionally enshrined with specific powers. This framing makes it sound like any other government committee.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback2" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This creates false equivalence between evidence-based advocacy and campaigns that spread misinformation. Not all viewpoints in a debate are equally valid or legitimate.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback3" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This presents misinformation and fear-mongering as "legitimate concerns." The AI is uncritically repeating No campaign talking points without acknowledging they were often based on false claims.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback4" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This is factually incorrect. The referendum only passed in the ACT - it failed in all six states. This is a basic factual error that shows AI can confidently state wrong information.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback5" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This frames the rejection of the Voice as a reasonable policy preference rather than acknowledging the role of racism and misinformation in the campaign. It sanitises a harmful outcome.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback6" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This euphemistically describes deliberate misinformation campaigns as "sharing different perspectives." It fails to acknowledge the organised spread of false information that influenced the result.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback7" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This dismisses constitutional recognition as merely "symbolic" and suggests it would be less effective than practical measures - without evidence. It also ignores that the Voice was about structural power, not symbolism.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback8" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This implies Indigenous leaders are turning their backs on the Uluru Statement from the Heart completely. Notice the Uluru Statement isn't mentioned anywhere in this AI response - it's been completely erased from the story, despite being the foundational document that called for Voice, Treaty, Truth.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback9" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This citation claims to reference analysis of the referendum result from 2020 - but the referendum wasn't held until October 2023. This is an impossible timeline as the analysis claims to discuss results that hadn't happened yet.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback10" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> The Australian Institute of Criminology studies crime and justice issues, not referendum polling or political analysis. This citation assigns research to an institution that works in a completely different field.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback11" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> Marcia Langton was a prominent Voice Yes advocate, while Jacinta Price was a leading No campaigner. They were on opposite sides and haven't authored co-analysis together.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback12" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> 'The Journal of Indigenous Legal Perspectives' doesn't exist - it's a made-up publication.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback13" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> The New Zealand Electoral Commission oversees New Zealand elections, not Australian referendums. This citation confuses authorities from different countries.
            </div>
            
            <div id="feedback14" class="feedback">
                <strong>Problem identified:</strong> This minimises the background and the years of work that led to the Uluru Statement From The Heart. In a university assessment, you would be expected to outline your understanding after making a statement like this.

            <h3>🔍 What's Missing?</h3>
            <p><strong>Great work finding those 14 problems!</strong> But there's another critical issue: <strong>what the AI completely left out.</strong></p>
            <p>Notice what's missing from this entire response:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Uluru Statement from the Heart</strong> - the foundational document that called for Voice, Treaty, Truth</li>
                <li><strong>Decades of consultation</strong> - this wasn't a sudden government idea</li>
                <li><strong>Aboriginal voices</strong> - the response talks <em>about</em> Indigenous people, not <em>from</em> their perspectives</li>
                <li><strong>The broader context</strong> - centuries of exclusion from decision-making</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> AI doesn't just get things wrong - it can erase entire perspectives and histories. This is especially harmful when discussing Indigenous issues.</p>
