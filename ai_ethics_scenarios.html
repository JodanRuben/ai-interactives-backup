            <strong>❌ Not the best approach.</strong><br>
            AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data that may not represent authentic Aboriginal voices or current community priorities. Using AI as your primary source risks perpetuating outdated or culturally inappropriate information. Aboriginal health is complex and requires understanding community perspectives, not just medical statistics.

        <div class="feedback good" id="feedback1-good">
            <strong>✅ Best choice!</strong><br>
            This approach shows respect. AI can help you organise your thinking and research strategy, but Aboriginal voices and community-authored sources should drive your understanding. This ensures you're engaging with authentic perspectives rather than AI interpretations of cultural knowledge.

            <strong>⚠️ Be mindful.</strong><br>
            Always start the research process yourself. You are here to make learning leaps, don't let AI dictate how things go. Use university library and database search for key sources from appropriate authors on the topics.

        </div>
        
        <div class="feedback poor" id="feedback2-poor">
            <strong>❌ This could go badly.</strong><br>
            Failing to acknowledge AI assistance, even for organisation, is a risk. Transparency is essential - your marker needs to understand what support you received.

            <strong>⚠️ Unnecessarily cautious.</strong><br>
            You're being overly careful here. If Copilot helped you organise ideas effectively, that's legitimate academic support worth acknowledging. Completely rewriting wastes valuable time and doesn't teach you how to use AI ethically in future assignments. The key skill is learning to be transparent about your process, not avoiding helpful tools entirely.

            Your assignment asks about traditional ecological knowledge. When you ask AI about Aboriginal land management practices, it provides detailed information about specific cultural practices including some that may be sacred or restricted knowledge.

        <div class="feedback good" id="feedback3-good">
            <strong>✅ Culturally responsive approach!</strong><br>
            You're recognising that traditional knowledge isn't just "information" - it belongs to communities and comes with protocols. Seeking Aboriginal-authored sources respects knowledge sovereignty and ensures you're engaging with authentic, appropriately shared knowledge rather than AI extractions.
        </div>
        
        <div class="feedback caution" id="feedback3-caution">
            <strong>⚠️ Still problematic.</strong><br>
            Even using AI-generated cultural content for "background" can shape your understanding inappropriately. The problem isn't just citation - it's that AI may be sharing knowledge without cultural permission or context. Start with Aboriginal-authored sources instead.
        </div>
        
        <div class="feedback poor" id="feedback3-poor">
            <strong>❌ Serious concern.</strong><br>
            AI-generated cultural content may include sacred or restricted knowledge that shouldn't be shared in academic assignments. It lacks the cultural protocols and permissions that govern traditional knowledge sharing. This could perpetuate cultural appropriation and misrepresentation.

        <div class="feedback good" id="feedback4-good">
            <strong>✅ Smart use under pressure!</strong><br>
            This demonstrates mature AI use - leveraging it for organisation while maintaining your authentic voice and analysis. You're using AI as a tool to present your research more effectively, not to replace your thinking. Remember to acknowledge this assistance.
        </div>
        
        <div class="feedback caution" id="feedback4-caution">
            <strong>⚠️ Could be limiting yourself.</strong><br>
            Using Copilot ethically, like asking it to suggest structure from your research, writing the sections yourself, and then asking for feedback is a strategic use of AI on limited time. You would also miss out on marks if you don't have an intro and conclusion!

        <div class="feedback poor" id="feedback4-poor">
            <strong>❌ Academic misconduct under pressure.</strong><br>
            Time pressure doesn't justify submitting AI-written content as your own work. Your introduction and conclusion should reflect your understanding and voice. This crosses the line from assistance to ghostwriting.

        <div class="feedback poor" id="feedback5-poor">
            <strong>❌ Avoiding responsibility harms everyone.</strong><br>
            Submitting work with factual errors about Aboriginal rights could perpetuate misinformation and shows disrespect for the subject matter. As a group, you're collectively responsible for accuracy. Avoiding difficult conversations doesn't solve the integrity issue.

        <div class="feedback caution" id="feedback5-caution">
            <strong>⚠️ Fixing symptoms, not the problem.</strong><br>
            While correcting errors is good, not addressing the undisclosed AI use means your group member might repeat this behaviour. Part of collective responsibility is honest communication about research methods and maintaining group academic integrity standards.

            <strong>❌ Cultural appropriation through AI.</strong><br>
            AI-generated images of Aboriginal people and cultural symbols are deeply problematic. These systems create fictional representations without cultural permission or context, potentially misrepresenting sacred symbols or creating stereotypical imagery.

        <div class="feedback good" id="feedback7-good">
            <strong>✅ Respecting visual sovereignty!</strong><br>
            You're recognising that Aboriginal imagery isn't just "content" to generate - it represents real people and sacred cultural elements. Using authentic, properly credited visuals supports Aboriginal artists and maintains cultural integrity. Your poster will be more respectful and academically sound.

        <div class="feedback caution" id="feedback7-caution">
            <strong>⚠️ Decent, but still be cautious.</strong><br>
            While avoiding cultural imagery is good, consider whether AI-generated elements are necessary at all. Simple, respectful design using authentic sources often has more impact than AI-enhanced visuals. Focus your energy on presenting the activist stories powerfully rather than decorative elements.

            <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aboriginal knowledge sovereignty matters:</strong> Always prioritise Aboriginal-authored sources and community perspectives</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency is non-negotiable:</strong> Acknowledge AI assistance, even for organisation and structure</li>
                <li><strong>AI as tool, not replacement:</strong> Use AI to enhance your research process, not replace your thinking</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural protocols apply:</strong> Traditional knowledge and visual representations require community permission and appropriate cultural context</li>
            </ul>
